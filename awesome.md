> (1) publicly available and actively maintained (a commit or post in the
> last ~6 months), (2) specific to Claude Code or the Claude API in a way a
> generic list can't cover, (3) either the author or a reviewer has used it
> in real work — not just read the README.
>
> Want to add something? Open a PR editing this file. Keep descriptions to
> one line, alphabetical within each section, and add a one-sentence
> justification in the PR body.
