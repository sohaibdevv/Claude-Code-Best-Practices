## Why this repo exists

Claude Code is powerful out of the box, but the gap between *"it works"* and *"it ships production code reliably"* is closed by a handful of patterns: a sharp `CLAUDE.md`, the right permission mode, hooks that catch mistakes before they reach disk, skills for repeat tasks, and a cost model you can reason about. Most of that knowledge is scattered across blog posts, Discord threads, and internal wikis.

This repo pulls it together into one place — **opinionated, tested, and dogfooded on itself.** Every convention here has been used to build the repo you're reading: the `.claude/` directory wires the hooks, the `/lint-docs` skill runs the same checks CI does, and the commit log is a working example of the Conventional Commits skill under `plugins/commit-helper/`.

### What you'll find

- **30+ guides** covering fundamentals, workflows, permissions, advanced architecture, cost management, and security — including auto mode and its safety classifier.
- **11 `CLAUDE.md` templates** for React, Python, Go, Rust, Rails, Django, Next.js, Spring Boot, Flutter, monorepos, and a minimal starter.
- **5 starter kits** — whole-project drop-ins (`CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/` with settings, skills, and hooks) for React, Next.js, Python, Go, and Rust.
- **Working plugin** (`commit-helper`) with a Conventional Commits skill and a `PreToolUse` hook that blocks secrets before they're committed.
- **Drop-in skills and hook scripts** — `/changelog`, `/pr-describe`, `/test-triage`, plus `block-secrets`, `format-on-write`, and `test-on-stop`.
- **Published benchmarks** — model comparison, plan-mode on/off, CLAUDE.md payoff, and prompt-cache impact, with a reproducible harness so you can rerun them in your own repo.
- **Security playbook** covering prompt injection, plugin supply chain, and team audit checklists.
- **Dogfooded `.claude/` setup** you can copy — see [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) and [`.claude/`](./.claude/).

### Who it's for

- **Individual developers** setting up Claude Code for the first time and wanting to skip the "figuring it out" phase.
- **Teams** standardizing how their engineers use Claude Code — shared configs, permission policies, and onboarding docs.
- **Tooling authors** building plugins, skills, or hooks who want reference implementations to study.

$ claude "Fix the failing test in src/utils/dates.test.ts"

 ● Reading src/utils/dates.test.ts...
 ● Reading src/utils/dates.ts...
 ● Found the bug: parseDate() doesn't handle ISO strings with timezone offsets.
 ● Editing src/utils/dates.ts — added offset normalization before parsing.
 ● Running npm test...
 ● All 47 tests passing.

 Done. Fixed the timezone offset handling in parseDate().
 One file changed, 3 lines added, 1 line removed.
```

One prompt. Claude reads the code, finds the bug, fixes it, and verifies the tests pass. The guides in this repo are about getting to that kind of loop on your own codebase — reliably, cheaply, and without surprises.

## Quick Start

1. **Install:** `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
2. **Authenticate:** run `claude` and follow the prompts to log in.
3. **Drop in a starter kit** (recommended for new projects): `cp -r starters/<stack>/. /path/to/your/repo/`. See the [starters overview](starters/README.md).
4. **Or generate a CLAUDE.md** for an existing project: `bash tools/generate-claude-md.sh`, or use the [Quickstart Prompt](tools/quickstart-prompt.md) to have Claude write one from your codebase.
5. **Start coding:** run `claude` in your project.

New to all of this? Read [Getting Started](guides/getting-started.md) → [CLAUDE.md Guide](guides/claude-md-guide.md) → [Workflow Patterns](guides/workflow-patterns.md) in that order. Each is ~10 minutes.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for style conventions and the PR process. Every PR runs through five CI checks:

| Check | What it catches |
|-------|-----------------|
| [shellcheck](.github/workflows/shellcheck.yml) | Shell bugs in any `.sh` under the repo |
| [markdownlint](.github/workflows/markdownlint.yml) | Markdown structure issues (headings, lists, code fences) |
| [links](.github/workflows/links.yml) | Broken internal and external links |
| [lint-claude-md](.github/workflows/lint-claude-md.yml) | CLAUDE.md structure issues in every template |
| [docs](.github/workflows/docs.yml) | mkdocs-material site build — catches broken nav and missing files |

A sixth workflow ([benchmarks](.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml)) is wired up but **manual-only** — it calls the Anthropic API and bills whoever runs it for tokens. Trigger it with **Actions → benchmarks → Run workflow** on a fork with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set as a repo secret.
