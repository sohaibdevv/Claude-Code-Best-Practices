# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [1.7.0] - 2026-09-15

### Added
- **Auto Mode guide** ([`guides/auto-mode.md`](guides/auto-mode.md)) — covers
  the classifier-driven permission mode (research preview March 2026, default
  on Pro/Max/Team since August 2026): what it approves vs. escalates, the
  safety classifier and sandboxing split, per-command `allowed_domains`
  (v2.1.271), changed inline-`!` and subagent hand-back behavior, and Monitor
  watch deadlines. Cross-linked bidirectionally with `permission-modes.md`,
  `security-practices.md`, `ci-and-automation.md`, and `hooks.md`.
- **Setup Auditor tool** —
  [`tools/audit-claude-setup.sh`](tools/audit-claude-setup.sh) and
  [`tools/audit-claude-setup.md`](tools/audit-claude-setup.md) score a
  project's Claude Code setup out of 100 across CLAUDE.md, settings.json,
  permissions, and hooks; exit 1 below 60 or on any FAIL with `--strict`,
  so they work as a CI gate.
- **Rust starter kit** ([`starters/rust/`](starters/rust/)) — drop-in kit for
  Axum/Actix services: `CLAUDE.md` with layering/error-handling/testing
  conventions, cargo allowlist + `cargo publish` deny in settings, vendored
  hooks, and an `/add-endpoint` skill.

### Changed
- **Pricing corrected across tools.** Opus list pricing is $5/$25 per million
  tokens (fast mode $10/$50), not the $15/$75 the tools assumed.
  [`tools/benchmark.sh`](tools/benchmark.sh) and
  [`tools/estimate-cost.sh`](tools/estimate-cost.sh) now carry correct
  prices, and the harness default model list uses `opus-4.8`.
- **Benchmarks guide documents the pricing correction**
  ([`guides/benchmarks.md`](guides/benchmarks.md)) — the 2026-04-22 reference
  run is kept as recorded, with a dated note explaining that quoted Opus
  costs overstate by ~3x and a corrected Sonnet-vs-Opus ratio (~1.5x, not
  ~4.6x). TL;DR updated to match. Numbers were **not rerun**; trigger the
  benchmarks workflow on a fork with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for fresh data.
- **Versions and model IDs refreshed.** Bumped Claude Code references from
  `v2.1.139` to `v2.1.272` where they mean "current version" (README header,
  harness requirement, bug-report template) and Opus references from `4.7`
  to `4.8` across README, `context-management.md`, `cost-management.md`,
  `performance-tuning.md`, `troubleshooting.md`, and `goal-mode.md`.
  Historical "added in v2.1.139" feature attributions are unchanged.
- **README tables updated** — Auto Mode added to Workflows and Permissions,
  Setup Auditor added to the Toolbox, Rust added to starter kits (now five),
  and the header bumped to v1.7 / 2026-09-15.
- **mkdocs nav updated** — Auto Mode guide, Setup Auditor doc, and the
  Rust + Next.js starter kits (Next.js was missing from nav since v1.5).

## [1.6.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- **Agent View guide** ([`guides/agent-view.md`](guides/agent-view.md)) —
  covers the `claude agents` dashboard added in Claude Code v2.1.139. When to
  use it vs. tmux or worktrees, how it interacts with `/teams`, and
  triage/cost workflows. Cross-linked bidirectionally with `multi-agent.md`,
  `cost-management.md`, and `context-management.md`.
- **Goal Mode guide** ([`guides/goal-mode.md`](guides/goal-mode.md)) — covers
  the `/goal` command added in Claude Code v2.1.139. Completion-condition
  patterns (good vs. bad), when goal mode beats plan mode + manual loops,
  cost implications of "keeps working across turns," and behaviour in
  interactive, `-p` headless, and Remote Control modes. Cross-linked
  bidirectionally with `workflow-patterns.md`, `permission-modes.md`,
  `cost-management.md`, and `ci-and-automation.md`.

### Changed
- **Security guides document `disableSkillShellExecution`** (new in v2.1.139)
  in [`guides/security-practices.md`](guides/security-practices.md) and
  [`guides/security-playbook.md`](guides/security-playbook.md). Added to the
  recommended default `.claude/settings.json` snippet, the per-user audit
  checklist, and the security checklist. Threat model: a future malicious
  plugin update cannot add inline `curl … | sh` to a `SKILL.md` and have it
  execute.
- **MCP guides cover `_meta["anthropic/maxResultSizeChars"]`** (new in
  v2.1.139). [`guides/mcp-servers.md`](guides/mcp-servers.md) adds a
  "Handling Large Tool Results" section with a table of when to override the
  default truncation cap (up to 500K chars).
  [`guides/building-custom-mcp-servers.md`](guides/building-custom-mcp-servers.md)
  adds TypeScript and Python snippets showing how server authors set the
  annotation, plus guidance on picking a cap and paginating instead of
  maxing out.
- **Versions and metadata refreshed.** Bumped Claude Code references from
  `v2.1.122` to `v2.1.139` across [`README.md`](README.md),
  [`guides/benchmarks.md`](guides/benchmarks.md),
  [`guides/context-management.md`](guides/context-management.md),
  [`guides/cost-management.md`](guides/cost-management.md),
  [`guides/performance-tuning.md`](guides/performance-tuning.md),
  [`guides/troubleshooting.md`](guides/troubleshooting.md),
  [`tools/benchmark.sh`](tools/benchmark.sh), and the bug-report template.
  Opus 4.7 / Sonnet 4.6 / Haiku 4.5 unchanged.
- **README header updated** — "Last updated" bumped to May 12, 2026,
  version chip to v1.6, "Current release" line in the versioning section
  set to v1.6.0.

### Notes
- Benchmark numbers in [`guides/benchmarks.md`](guides/benchmarks.md) were
  **not rerun** for this release — only the version-line metadata was bumped.
  The "Last reference run" date (2026-04-22) is intentionally unchanged.
  Rerun the harness on a fork with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set if you want fresh
  numbers under v2.1.139.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- **Next.js starter kit** ([`starters/nextjs/CLAUDE.md`](starters/nextjs/)) —
  drop-in `CLAUDE.md` for Next.js 15 (App Router) projects with conventions for
  Server vs. Client Components, server actions, Prisma/auth wiring, and the
  Vitest + Playwright test layout. Mirrors the structure of the React starter.
- **`claude-md-checker` plugin** ([`plugins/claude-md-checker/`](plugins/claude-md-checker/))
  — `PreToolUse` hook on `Edit`/`Write` that runs `tools/lint-claude-md.sh`
  against any file whose basename is `CLAUDE.md`. Blocks the write on lint
  errors (exit 2) and surfaces the lint output. Warnings (exit 1) pass
  through. No-ops cleanly when no linter is on disk.

### Changed
- **Versions and model IDs refreshed.** Bumped Claude Code references from
  `v2.1.92` to `v2.1.122` and Opus references from `4.6` to `4.7` across
  [`README.md`](README.md), [`guides/benchmarks.md`](guides/benchmarks.md),
  [`guides/cost-management.md`](guides/cost-management.md),
  [`guides/context-management.md`](guides/context-management.md),
  [`guides/performance-tuning.md`](guides/performance-tuning.md),
  [`guides/tips-and-tricks.md`](guides/tips-and-tricks.md),
  [`guides/troubleshooting.md`](guides/troubleshooting.md),
  [`tools/benchmark.sh`](tools/benchmark.sh), and the bug-report template.
  Sonnet 4.6 / Haiku 4.5 unchanged.
- **README tables updated** — added Next.js to the starters table and
  `claude-md-checker` to the plugins table; bumped the "Last updated" header
  to v1.5 / 2026-04-29.

### Notes
- Benchmark numbers in [`guides/benchmarks.md`](guides/benchmarks.md) were
  **not rerun** for this release — only the version-line metadata was bumped.
  Rerun the harness on a fork with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set if you want fresh
  numbers under v2.1.122.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Dogfooded repo setup** — [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) at repo root and
  [`.claude/`](./.claude/) wiring `block-secrets` + `format-on-write` hooks,
  a narrow permission allowlist, and a repo-local `/lint-docs` skill. We use
  Claude Code to maintain the repo that teaches Claude Code.
- **Anti-Patterns Gallery** ([`guides/anti-patterns.md`](guides/anti-patterns.md)) —
  14 annotated bad/fixed pairs across CLAUDE.md, hooks, and prompts, cross-linked
  to the positive-space guides.
- **Starter kits** ([`starters/`](starters/)) — whole-project drop-in kits with
  `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/` (settings, skills, hooks) for React, Python, and
  Go. Each kit is self-contained (hook scripts copied in, not referenced) so
  it can be dropped into a project with a single `cp -r`.
- **Security Playbook** ([`guides/security-playbook.md`](guides/security-playbook.md)) —
  covers prompt injection from tool results, plugin supply chain, per-repo and
  per-user audit checklists, and a recommended default `.claude/settings.json`.
- **Published site** — [`mkdocs.yml`](mkdocs.yml) + `requirements-docs.txt`
  wire up mkdocs-material with search, nav mirroring the README sections, and
  a dark/light palette. Deployed via [`.github/workflows/docs.yml`](.github/workflows/docs.yml)
  to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.
- **Benchmarks workflow (bring your own key)** —
  [`.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml`](.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml) wires
  up the harness to run in CI, commit CSVs to
  [`benchmarks/history/YYYY-MM-DD.csv`](benchmarks/history/), and regenerate
  [`benchmarks/latest.md`](benchmarks/latest.md) via
  [`tools/benchmark-summary.sh`](tools/benchmark-summary.sh). The nightly
  cron is **commented out** — running the harness bills the owner of
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for tokens, and this repo isn't funding that right now.
  Manual `workflow_dispatch` still works; uncomment the `schedule:` block on
  a fork with a key set to turn nightly on.
- **CI quality gates** ([`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows/)):
  - `shellcheck.yml` — shellcheck on every `.sh` on push/PR (fails on warnings).
  - `markdownlint.yml` — `markdownlint-cli` against all markdown with a shared
    `.markdownlint.json`.
  - `links.yml` — `lychee` link checker on push/PR and a weekly schedule to
    catch external rot.
  - `lint-claude-md.yml` — runs `tools/lint-claude-md.sh` against every
    `examples/claude-md-*.md` and the repo's own `CLAUDE.md`.
- Status badges for six CI workflows in the README, plus a link to the
  published site.
- **Awesome list** ([`awesome.md`](awesome.md)) — curated community plugins,
  skills, essays, talks, and adjacent tooling, with explicit inclusion
  criteria so it stays signal-heavy.
- **Decision trees** ([`guides/decision-trees.md`](guides/decision-trees.md)) —
  Mermaid flowcharts for "which model?" and "plan mode when?" with
  plain-text fallbacks for viewers without Mermaid support, calibrated from
  the benchmark numbers.
- **Issue and PR templates** ([`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/),
  [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)) —
  bug, tool/workflow, and guide request forms with `config.yml` routing
  open-ended questions to Discussions; PR template checklist ties to the
  style rules in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Social preview card** ([`.github/social-preview.svg`](.github/social-preview.svg))
  — 1280×640 SVG source. Convert with `rsvg-convert`, Inkscape, or ImageMagick,
  then upload via **Repo → Settings → General → Social preview**.
- **Extra README badges** — License, PRs-welcome, and Awesome-list badges;
  new Community section linking the awesome list, Discussions, and Issues.

### Fixed
- `tools/hooks/block-secrets.sh` and
  `plugins/commit-helper/hooks/block-secret-commits.sh` — `grep -E` was parsing
  the `-----BEGIN …` pattern as a flag; added `--` separator. Caught by
  dogfooding the hook against the anti-patterns guide draft.
- `plugins/commit-helper/hooks/block-secret-commits.sh` — renamed a local
  `command` variable that shadowed the `command` builtin.
- `tools/hooks/test-on-stop.sh` — parenthesized a `||`/`&&` chain whose
  precedence was ambiguous.

### Notes
- CI badge URLs assume the repo is hosted at
  `github.com/sohaibdevv/claude-code-best-practices`. Update them if
  you fork.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Benchmarks guide** ([`guides/benchmarks.md`](guides/benchmarks.md)) — published
  numbers for model comparison, plan mode on/off, CLAUDE.md payoff, and prompt
  cache impact, with guidance on how to read the ratios.
- **Benchmark harness** ([`tools/benchmark.sh`](tools/benchmark.sh)) — reproducible
  headless harness (`claude -p ... --output-format json`) that runs a fixed task
  set across models and emits a CSV with tokens, duration, cost, and outcome.
- **`commit-helper` plugin** ([`plugins/commit-helper/`](plugins/commit-helper/)) —
  a working Claude Code plugin: Conventional Commits skill plus a `PreToolUse`
  hook that blocks `git commit` when staged content contains secrets.
- **Example skills** ([`examples/skills/`](examples/skills/)) — drop-in
  `/changelog`, `/pr-describe`, and `/test-triage` skills with full `SKILL.md`
  manifests.
- **Standalone hook scripts** ([`tools/hooks/`](tools/hooks/)) — `block-secrets`,
  `format-on-write`, and `test-on-stop` as installable `.sh` files, each with
  dry-run instructions and a one-line install recipe.

### Changed
- README reorganized: new "Plugins and Skills" section, Benchmarks linked under
  Cost & Efficiency, Toolbox expanded with hooks and harness.

### Notes
- Benchmark numbers in the guide are representative (from the 2026-04-22 run
  against a medium Node.js repo). Rerun the harness in your own repo to get
  numbers that match your setup — the ratios travel; the absolutes don't.
